Description:

Alice is very fond of Permutations. A Permutation is defined as an array of size N, consisting of all the numbers from 1 to N exactly once.
For Example, [1,4,2,3] , [1,3,2], [1,2,3,4,5] are Permutations, where as [1,1,3] , [2,3,2,3], [1,3,4,5] are not.

Now he wishes to make the given array a Permutation. As he is busy with this exams, he is asking you to help him.

You are allowed to increment any element of array any number of times. One operation is equal to one increment(ie 5-->5+1, changing 5 to 6). 

You are required to calculate the minimum number of operations required to make array a permutation to make Alice happy.


Standard Input:
The first line consists of integer N, number of elements in an array.
The second line consists of N spaced integers, the elements of the array .
(The input array is always sorted)

Standard Output:
One single integer, the number of operations required to make Array a Permutation

Constraints
1 <= N <= 1e5
1 <= Ai <= i

Sample Input 1:
3
1 1 1

Sample Output 1:
3
 
Explaination:
We need to have 1,2,3 to make array a permutation. 
So, 
At i=2, increment it once makes it 2
At i=3, increment it twice to make it 3
We need 3(ie 1+2) increments to make it a Permutation.
