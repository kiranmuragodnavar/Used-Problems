Description:

You're given an array A consisting on N integers.

Your task is to find if there is any subsequence of length atleast 3 (length>=3) , which is a Palindrome.

Array B is called a subsequence of array A if it is obtained by removing some(possibly zero) elements from the array A, 
without changing the order of elements.
For example, given A->[2,6,1,7,2]. 
[2] , [2,7] , [2,1,7] , [2,6,7],[2,6,1]  are subsequences of array whereas,
[6,2] , [1,6,7] , [2,2,7] , [1,6,2] are not subsequences of array A.



Palindrome Array is an Array which reads the same when read backward.
[1,2,1] , [1,1,1] , [1] , [2,3,5,3,2] are examples of Palindrome Array
[1,2,2] , [1,2] are some of the examples which are not Palindrome Array


Input format:
The first line T consists number of test cases

Next ( 2*T ) lines of describes testcases.
The first line consists of N,the size of the Array
The second line consists of N spaced integers, the elements of the Array

Output format:
T lines of output, if there exists a Palindrome print "YES" or else "NO" (without quotes).

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= Ai <= 1e9




Sample Input:
5
3
1 3 1
6
1 2 3 4 5 6
6
4 4 3 3 7 7 
6
7 2 1 7 0 2
5
3 2 7 4 2 

Sample Output:
YES
NO
NO
YES 
YES



Sample Explanation:

Case 1: [1,3,1] forms a Palindrome
Case 2: There can not be any Palindrome formed which are of length greater than or equal to 3.
Case 3: There can not be any Palindrome formed which are of length greater than or equal to 3.
Case 4: [7,2,7] , [2,7,7,2] are the subsequences which forms Palindrome
Case 5: [2,7,2] , [2,4,2] are the subsequences which forms Palindrome
