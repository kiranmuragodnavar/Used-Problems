Description:

Alice is a developer at a social medial platform.
He has been given a task to validate password of all the users who signs up to their platform.
As he is busy in some other work, he is asking your help.

For a password to be valid, below conditions must be satisfied,
1. The length of the password must be >=8.
2. It must consist of number 0
3. It must consist of any one odd number (either 1/3/5/7/9)
4. It must have atleast one special character (either @ or # or $ or * or & or _)


The password is said to be valid only if it satisfies all the above conditions
You have to just print YES if its valid, NO if its not

Note: No space is included

Input format:
The first line T consists number of test cases
Next T lines consists of strings ie the passowrd to be validated


Output format:
T lines of output, if it is a valid password print "YES" or else "NO" (without quotes).

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 1000
1 <= len(S) <= 1e5


Sample Input:
4
I#*56ad0Bg
01234
**U03
abcde052ea
 

Sample Output:
YES
NO
NO
NO


Sample Explanation:

Case 1: It satisfies all the above 4 conditions
Case 2: It satisfies only condition 2 and 3
Case 3: It satisfies condition 2,3,4, but its length is 5, which is less than 8, hence invalid
Case 4: It doesnt have a special character, hence it is invalid
