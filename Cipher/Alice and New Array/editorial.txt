Going on adding values to the array results in exceeding the limit of the array, hence its not the
optimal solution. One can notice that when the ai is divisible by x, ai/x is added x times which means the
added values make sum of ai itself.

Traverse each element of array, for each element, till ai is divisble by x, add ai to the sum and divide ai/x.
This gives the sum of the updated array.
