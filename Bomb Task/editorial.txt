This problem can be solved using stacks.

We can use a stack as well as another count variable.  

So, traverse the string, 

If we encounter 'A', push it into the stack.

If we encounter 'B',
Case 1: 
If stack is not empty, pop top most one element from the stack.

Case 2:
If stack is empty, increase the count value, as it can't be neutralised further, it would explode finally.

Output the value of size of stack + count variable.
