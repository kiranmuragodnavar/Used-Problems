Title:
Bomb Task

Description:

Commander Ryan is working in Armed Forces. Their military base is in threat due to attack by enemy forces. 
Enemy forces have planted N bombs in series. The bombs which are planted are of 2 types, type 'A' and type 'B'.
As a commander of the unit, he is responsible for neutralizing as many bombs as possible. If he fails to 
neutralize some or all the bombs they would explode and destroy the base.

He can neutralize the bombs in the following way:

You're given with the string of length N, which denotes the sequence of bombs (either of type A or B).

You can neutralize the bomb by following operation:

If there exists substring "AB" in the string, then that 2 bombs can be neutralized hence deleted from the string. 
The rest string is concatenated.
 
For ex:
In the string, BAABBB
BAABBB --> BABB --> BB

Your task is to find number of bombs that would explode finally. 



Standard Input:
The first line consists of integer N, the length of the string.
The second line consists of the string, of either 'A' or 'B'.


Standard Output:
Minimum Number of bombs that would explode after making above operation.


Constraints
1 <= N <= 1e5
Si is either 'A' or 'B'  


Sample Input 1:
5
BABAA

Sample Output 1:
3
 
Explaination:
Initial string BABAA 
BABAA --> BAA
So 3 bombs would explode after making one operation.
Note - You can't delete subtring of type "BA", only "AB" type of substring can be deleted.



Sample Input 2:
8
AABBABBA

Sample Output 2:
2


Explanation:
Initial String --> AABBABBA
AABBABBA --> AABBBA --> ABBA --> BA 
So 2 bombs would explode, after making 3 operations.
