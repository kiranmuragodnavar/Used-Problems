Title:
Maximum Goodness


Description:

Sujay has an array a consisting of N numbers. He is interested to find the maximum "Goodness value" of this Array.

Goodness value of an array is defined as abs(a[i]-a[j]), where 1<=i<=N and 1<=j<=N.

Also he is interested to find the number of ways through which he can select those 2 numbers from the array a, 
which gives the maximum Goodness Value



Input format:
The first line consists of N,the size of the Array
The second line consists of N spaced integers, the elements of the Array

Output format:
Two integers P and Q
P-->The maximum Goodness value
Q-->The number of ways (pairs) of obtaining the Goodness values



Constraints:
2 <= N <= 1e5
1 <= Ai <= 1e9

Sample Input:
6
2 1 1 4 7 2

Sample Output:
6 2

Sample Explanation:
P--> The maximum Goodness value can be obtained when we select the number 7 and 1. So P would be(7-1=6)
Q--> We can select the pair (1,7) by 2 ways, ie (A2 and A5), (A3 and A5) .
